# Unwriting
Unwriting is for media riffing based on improvised, keyboard-triggered display of visual and sound elements.  Unwriting software enables dynamic mixing of up to 260 quicktime files (videos, graphics, or sounds) using alpha-numeric keys (numbers and lower-case letters) of a standard keyboard.
